# LEFi âš’

LEFi (Lending Efficiency Finance) improves the capital efficiency for Aave and other lending protocols through earning yield on unused collateral while maintaining a constant health factor with a keeper.

When you open a position on LEFi, the protocol maintains a minimum collateral and buffer health factor on Aave by splitting the value received between collateralization and earning yield.
